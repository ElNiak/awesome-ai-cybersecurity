## Introduction

First, beginners should look at machine learning tasks and their applications. I wrote a **[machine learning blog](https://github.com/Billy1900/Awesome-Machine-Learning)** including CV (CNN, GAN), RL, GNN, NLP.

Additionally, developers still need to know more about security/cybersecurity, here is the **[awesome list of security tool and knowledge.](security.md)**

Then, let's turn to AI for cybersecurity.

The first dimension is a goal or a task. According to Gartnerâ€™s PPDR model, all security tasks can be divided into five categories:
- prediction
- prevention
- detection
- response
- monitoring

The second dimension is a technical layer and the list of layers for this dimension:
- network (network traffic analysis and intrusion detection)
- endpoint (anti-malware)
- application (WAF or database firewalls)
- user (UBA)
- process behavior (anti-fraud)
